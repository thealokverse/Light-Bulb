# Light-Bulb
Interactive Pull-String Light Bulb 💡   
This is a simple, fully interactive light bulb simulation created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can click (or tap) and drag the pull-string to toggle the light on and off, complete with realistic spring physics and an accompanying "click" sound.


## Features
Interactive Pull-String: Click and drag the handle to pull the string.

Physics-Based Animation: The string uses a simple spring-physics engine to realistically swing and snap back into place.

On/Off State: Toggling the string changes the background color and makes the bulb glow.

Sound Effects: A synthesized "click" and "clack" sound plays when the light is toggled (powered by Tone.js).

Vector Graphics: The bulb is a crisp SVG, so it looks great at any size.

Mobile Friendly: Works on both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch).
